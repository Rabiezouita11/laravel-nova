Once you have purchased a Nova license, you may download a Nova release from the "releases" section of the Nova website. After downloading a Zip file containing the Nova source code, you will need to install it as a Composer "path" repository within your Laravel application's composer.json file.

First, unzip the contents of the Nova release into a nova directory within your application's root directory. Once you have unzipped and placed the Nova source code within the appropriate directory, you are ready to update your composer.json file. You should add the following configuration to the file:

"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "path",
        "url": "./nova"
    }
],
Next, add laravel/nova to the require section of your composer.json file:

"require": {
    "php": "^7.2.5",
    "fideloper/proxy": "^4.2",
    "laravel/framework": "^7.0",
    "laravel/nova": "*"
},
After your composer.json file has been updated, run the composer update command in your console terminal:

composer update

Finally, run the nova:install and migrate Artisan commands. The nova:install command will install Nova's service provider and public assets within your application:

php artisan nova:install

php artisan migrate

After running this command, verify that the App\Providers\NovaServiceProvider was added to the providers array in your app configuration file. If it wasn't, you should add it manually. Of course, if your application does not use the App namespace, you should update the provider class name as needed.
